Burger  eater
This is an application in which you can enter burger names and then place them into a database.  You retrieve a list of available burgers, then you can virtually eat them without getting full. 

If you eat them, they will show up in the "eaten" area.

This uses handlebars, express, orm, heroku deployment, and splits up the coding into different files such as views, config, db, models, etc.
